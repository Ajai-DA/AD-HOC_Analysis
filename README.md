  # AD-HOC_Analysis
Atliq Hardware (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.

However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills.

Insights :
1. Atliq Hardware has performed well in year 2021 introducing 102 new products with Peripherals and Accessories bringing in the highest revenue followed by PC. 
2. PC is the strongest performing division, generating 39% of total sales while accounting for only 3% of overall quantities of products sold.
3. Try to tweak discounts rates such that the customers bring in more gross sales for the company. 
4.  Atliq can increase e-commerce sales by partnering with new e-commerce platforms with competitive discounts.
